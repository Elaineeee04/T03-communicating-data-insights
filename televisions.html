    <h1>Buying a New TV? Let’s Explore Energy Efficiency</h1>

    <!-- INTRO PANEL -->
    <section class="content-box intro">
      <p><strong>Buying a new TV?</strong> Screen size, brand, and features matter — but energy consumption affects your electricity bills every day.</p>
      <p>This page helps consumers understand TV options, sizes, brands, and energy use so they can make smarter choices.</p>
      <p class="transition">Let’s begin by looking at the types of TVs available in Australia.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 1: Screen Technologies -->
    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>What types of screen technologies are available?</h2>
      <div class="chart-box" id="chart-tech">
        <img src="images\ScreenTechnologies.png" alt="Pie Chart showing TV models by technology" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>Most models in Australia are LCD (LED), while OLEDs and LCDs are less frequent.</p>
      <p class="transition">Once you know the types, the next step is choosing the right size and brand.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 2: Screen Sizes -->
    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>What screen sizes are most common?</h2>
      <div class="chart-box" id="chart-size">
        <img src="images/ScreenSizes.png" alt="Bar Chart showing distribution of TV screen sizes" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>A wide range of TV screen sizes are currently available, from smaller models such as 16–20 inches up to larger sizes like 100–116 inches. The most frequent sizes are 55”, 65”, and 75”.</p>
      <p class="transition">After deciding on size, the next key factor is the brand.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 3: Brands -->
    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>Which brands have the largest number of models?</h2>
      <div class="chart-box" id="chart-brand">
        <img src="images/Brands.png" alt="Bar Chart showing number of TV models by brand" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>Different brands offer a range of models with varying screen technologies and energy ratings. Some brands, like <strong>LG</strong>, <strong>Samsung</strong>, and <strong>Kogan</strong>, provide a wider selection of energy-efficient models, giving consumers more choices.</p>
      <p class="transition">Now that we’ve explored what’s available, it’s time to see how these features translate into everyday energy use.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 4: Energy Use by Technology -->
    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>Which technologies are actually the most energy-efficient?</h2>
      <div class="chart-box" id="chart-energy-tech">
        <img src="images/EnergyUseByScreenTech.png" alt="Bar Chart showing average power consumption by TV technology" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>The screen technology that consumes the least amount of power is <strong>LCD</strong>, making it the most energy-efficient choice.</p>
      <p class="transition">Of course, TV size also matters — bigger screens usually use more energy. Let’s check.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 5: Screen Size vs Power -->
    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>How does screen size affect power use?</h2>
      <div class="chart-box" id="chart-size-power">
        <img src="images/ScreenSizeAgainstPowerUsage.png" alt="Scatter Plot showing screen size versus power consumption" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>As the screen size increases, the average power consumption generally increases. <strong>Bigger TVs = bigger bills.</strong></p>
      <p class="transition">So what does this mean for consumers? Let’s summarise.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section class="content-box conclusion">
      <h2>Recommendations for TV Buyers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose LCD (LED)</strong> if energy efficiency is your main concern.</li>
        <li><strong>Smaller screens</strong> mean lower power bills.</li>
        <li><strong>Popular brands</strong> offer variety, but focus on screen size and technology to save energy and money.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Choose the right TV for your needs: balance size, features, and long-term energy savings.</p>
